NAME
    OpenFrame::Segment::Apache2 - Apache2 segments for OpenFrame 3

SYNOPSIS
      # tricky to explain, but mostly:
      PerlHandler YourHandler

DESCRIPTION
    The OpenFrame::Segment::Apache2 distribution provides segments for
    OpenFrame 3 that convert from Apache2 requests to OpenFrame::Request
    objects and from OpenFrame::Response objects to produce an Apache2
    response.

    It will be demonstrated with a simple OpenFrame example which simply
    loads static content, OpenFrame::Example::Apache2Simple.

    The following configuration should be in httpd.conf:

      SetHandler  perl-script
      PerlSetVar  cwd /home/website/
      PerlHandler OpenFrame::Example::Apache2Simple

    The actual handler is quite short. The important part is to set up a
    pipeline which has a OpenFrame::Segment::Apache2::Request segment at the
    beginning and a OpenFrame::Segment::Apache2::Response as a cleanup
    segment.

    Note that there is also a "OpenFrame::Segment::Apache2::NoImages" which
    declines and lets Apache2 serve images.
